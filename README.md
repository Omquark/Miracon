## Miracon

Miracon is a NodeJS wrapper designed to fit with RCON for Minecraft, with an emphasis on ease of use and upgraded security through implementing
Role Based Access Control and limiting commands to roles.

Miracon is designed to work out of box with some configuration specific to your Minecraft server.

Currently, Miracon does not have access to commands, but can read ops files and create users based on their access level.

At this point, Miracon can create an admin user to administer roles along with current ops to the server.

There is a portion able to connect to a Minecraft server which sends a list comamnd, however it is disconnected from the main source barring further development.

There are no instructions yet how to start Miracon, but will be updated in a further expansion.

Preferred method is over https, but you will need a cert. One is supplied, with a CA

You will need to import the CA into your browser to accept TLS connections with the supplied certificates.
You can also use open-ssl to create your own CA and cert and use those.
	I have supplied instructions how to do this, but you're on your own with troubleshooting it working.
Another option is to acquire and supply your own cert signed by a common CA. I don't use this method for teting, so you'll need to look into it.

You can use http connections as well, but some features may not be supported.
The only password transferred is the user's during login. 
	At no other time is ANY password transferred between the client and browser.
	That said, when making a login request between nodejs and rcon, the password is sent PLAIN TEXT, AS PER RCON SPECS!
		There is NOTHING that I can do about this, your most secure option is to host this and your minecraft server on the same host.
		
With all that, the file at /opt/miracon/MIRACON.pem can be replaced with a file of your choice (PEM format).
The instructions provided give a PEM format certificate that can be used.
